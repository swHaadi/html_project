  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I m Haadi . I have completed my secondary education and now i m preparing my self for the medical entrance test
    to get admission in a medical college for MBBS. As i live in peshawar so my specified provincial test will be ETEA.
    I am actually a repeater.well when i failed to clear my test, that was my first failure in life.I had two options,
    sit and cry or rise and do something big.I stoop up and now i m a python programmer and have done my first project
    for the UET students (Final year project ) which was HMI based as well as studiying for that same test again.
  </p>

  <p>I have also started web development and this is my first practice project. Breaking out of the matrix is not that easy
    but with a strong determination and will power , I will break out of this damn matrix and will create My own
    world , where i can serve my parents. All i m doing is for them to live a beautiful life.
  </p>
